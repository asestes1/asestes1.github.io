> We study a type of network flow problem that we call the minimum-
cost F-graph flow problem. This problem generalizes the typical minimum-cost
network flow problem by allowing the underlying network to be a directed hy-
pergraph rather than a directed graph. This new problem is pertinent because
it can be used to model network flow problems that occur in a dynamic,
stochastic, environment. We formulate this problem as an integer program,
and we study specifically the case where every node has at least one outgoing
edge with no capacity constraint. We show that even with this restriction, the
problem of finding an integral solution is NP-Hard. However, we can show that
all of the inequality constraints of our formulation are either facet-defining or
redundant.
