> In this paper, we identify two weaknesses in the design
of the collaborative trajectory options program (CTOP) traffic
management initiative. First, CTOP may issue excessive quantities
of delay even when the parameters of the program are chosen
correctly. Second, CTOPâ€™s current design can discourage airlines
from accurately disclosing trajectory options. We propose new
mechanisms that address these design flaws. We also provide
computational results that demonstrate that our proposed
mechanisms would reduce delay costs and encourage greater
participation in CTOP.
