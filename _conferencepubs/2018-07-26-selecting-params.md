> We consider the problem of selecting a set of parameters for a ground delay program so that the program achieves a vector of performance objectives similar that is similar to a target vector. This could be used to support consensus-based ground delay program planning. We propose a method that selects several potential candidates of vectors and we compare our method with a simple greedy algorithm. Our results indicate that our proposed method is able to provide multiple solutions that are closer to the efficient frontier than the greedy solution.
