> Models are proposed to estimate the performance of
Ground Delay Programs as air traffic management initiatives.
We apply Random Forest and Gradient-Boosted Forest
regression techniques within the context of Geographically
Weighted Regression. We estimate both the mean and 90th
percentile responses for two performance indicators: average
arrival delay and the number of cancelled arrivals.
