> The Federal Aviation Administration uses traffic
management initiatives to prevent excessive congestion of
airspace resources. We present a method that would aid in the
planning of traffic management initiatives by identifying a
representative set of initiatives that have been run in the past. In
a more general unsupervised learning context, this method could
be used to identify a small set of data points that are
representative of the entire data set.
